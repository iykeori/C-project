# C-project
This project demonstrated my knowledge for programming concept like structures, link-list, pointers, arrays

Project (A) – Movie Tracker
This project is intended to incorporate many of the C programming features learned in
this course for application in a practical “real-life” situation. Your task is to construct a
working program which uses a linked list of structures to manage 8 fields.

Information to keep track of for each video: Movie Name

Director
Release Date
Rating
Cost per rental
Number of views in month
Currently rented to (customer id)
Rental Expiration

Use linked lists to store the structures and incorporate all the features listed below:
(1) Consider the user of your program at all times when prompting for a response from
the keyboard and how the information will be displayed to the user.
(2) When you start your program, the user should be presented with 2 options:
Start with new data or load previously stored data.

(3) Options to integrate: Add new entries
Browse entries
Modify entry
Delete entry
Save data
Sort into alphabetical order (for display - scrolling)
Search for a movie title
Tally up the month’s earnings from all the rentals

Strategy:
Start small (3 movies or less). Add each of the options one at a time and be sure to
retest your program before adding the next option. You are to pass in :
- All source code (final version)
- A file database which will load your last “save”
